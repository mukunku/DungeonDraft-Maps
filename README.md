# DungeonDraft-Maps

This repo contains random maps I've made using [dungeon draft](https://dungeondraft.net/) _mostly_ using default assets. Feel free to use them as you wish.

Each map has:
* `.webp` images at max quality
* `.dungeondraft_map` file so you can open and edit the map yourself
* `.dd2vtt` file so you can directly import the map into your favorite VTT application such as FoundryVTT
